# Gw2Api

Source : https://github.com/Nithanim/gw2api
I just converted this Maven Project to a Java Project and fixed some "bugs".
\n
This project uses Lombok : for Eclipse users, just run lombok.jar (included in "lib" folder) as a java app (usually doubleclick it) to install it. \n
All required librairies for this project are in "lib" folder. (Don't forget to include lombok even after installation) \n
If you just want this project as a library, check the "jar" folder.
